DATA 221 ASSIGNMENT 1

# Assignment Solutions Summary

## Question 1 – Controlled Multiplication Loop
This solution multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a given threshold.  
It tracks the current multiplier and prints both the final product and the integer that caused the threshold to be exceeded.

## Question 3 – Safe Function Application
A function is defined to compute x to the power y.  
The program loops through a list of (x, y) pairs, skips any pair with a negative exponent, stores valid results in a list, and prints the list.

## Question 4 – Sorted Search with Conditions
A list of random values between 0 and 1 is generated and sorted.  
The program finds all indices where values are greater than or equal to a random value x and prints the sorted list, x, and the first matching index if it exists.

## Question 5 – Circle Area Comparison with Validation
This function validates that both radii are positive before calculating the area of each circle.  
It returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle.

## Question 6 – Distribution Analysis
The function creates a dictionary of unique values from a list, sorted by key.  
Each value represents the percentage of elements in the list that are less than or equal to the key.

## Question 7 – Time Conversion Function
This function converts seconds since midnight into a formatted 12-hour time string with AM or PM.  
Invalid inputs return an appropriate error message.

## Question 8 – Pandas DataFrame with Computed Column
A pandas DataFrame is created using provided data.  
A new column is added by performing a calculation on existing columns, and the final DataFrame is printed.
